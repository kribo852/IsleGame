this is a small and unfinished game I am working on in my spare time. It is an explore and survive sort of a game,
much inspired by games such as The Forest and Minecraft. I am building it on my raspberry computer and hope that it plays alright on other 
micro computers as well. I hope to add some making of tools and buildings and to add monsters or ghosts or something.
I plan to have the goal of the game to feed as many islanders as possible and have a highscore in the form of the highest achieved 
population on an island. The project is under the licence GPL3, which I have not read that *thoroughly but which seems okay.
