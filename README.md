This is a small and unfinished game I am working on in my spare time.

It is an explore and survive sort of a game,much inspired by games such as The Forest and Minecraft. 

I am building it on my raspberry computer and hope that it plays alright on other micro computers as well.

The game could use some optimization, but if it runs slow, don't hesitate to change the trees to ones with sprites,
and to turn off the rain.

Currently it is a bit wonky but the game motto is: more playable day by day(joke).

I hope to add some making of tools and buildings and to add monsters or ghosts or something.

I plan to have the goal of the game to feed as many islanders as possible and have a highscore in the form of the highest achieved 
population on an island.

It is possible to land on the islands given that the boat is in the right position, from sea, it should be automatic.

it is now possible to craft ropes, stone axes and fishnets by placing items on the ground in the correct order,
see the ItemAssembler class in Inventory.java for the exact patterns.
 
The next step will be to dewonkify the project and clean the code a bit.

I also hope that nothing is missing from the git commit, but in the case of missing sprites, try to paint some.


The project, except for the sprites, is under the licence GPL3 
which I have not read that *thoroughly but which seems to work for my purposes.
The sprites/pictures comes without a license.

compile it using the terminal command javac *java. Run it by typing java main in the terminal.
On Windows machins I recoment using the Eclipse IDE to run the game.
